#Hello codetech,My name is Mohd Zaki.i am AWS DevOps intern.my task is that i have to create EC2 machine with the help of terraform.
#firstly for doing the task i have to create a virtual machine with the help of putty software for getting the linux interface.In it we can execute the commands for terraform and writr script.
#now we need to execute the commands for installing terraform then we can write script then executes commands for apply the script.following commands for update and install terraform.
ec2-user    #(log in as ec2user)
sudo su-     #(for root user)
yum update -y     #(updating machine)
yum install wget unzip vim -y      #(we have to intall this packages beacause we need this for installing terraform)
wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform     #(This link is copied from google for linux operating system for download terraform)
vi terraformscript.tf       #(for creating terraform file,here we can write terraform script and following is  script untill we reach !wq)
  provider "aws"{
            region="ap-south-1"
            access_key="AKIA468WDIKHJGF"
            secret_key="diy2hkjghyyiwxk"
  }
  resource"aws_instance""AWSEC2INSTANCE"{
            count="4"
            ami="ami-06a04be23d"
            instancea_type="t2.micro"
            security_groups=["lanch-wizard-2"]
            key_name="terraformscript"
            tags={ name="codetech"}
  }
  !wq            #( for exit from terrraformfile and now we execute coammands for executing secript )
terraform init       #( this command is for initialize working directory containing terraform configrtion file.)
terraform fmt         #(this command is used for correct the indentation of script in proper manner)
terraform validate        #(this command is used for checking the syntax like comma etc.)
terraform plan              #( it gives a review of script)
terraform apply              #(for apply the terraform script )

#after this process we get 4 virtual machines of named codetech automatically and in the server we get terrafor,.tfstate file. In prduction environment terraform.tf state file valuable.
